# The Company is currently wanting to produce another 500 units of product sku 276834, which is a lamp with a circular base. Unfortunately, a staff member forgot to order the plywood to make the base and didnâ€™t account for the cost of this wood.
# Plywood can be purchased in 1200 X 2400 mm sheets at a cost of $28.47 per sheet.
# Each lamp base is a circle with a diameter of 320mm. 
# What is the total cost of ordering the plywood for the bases, and how much plywood is wasted?
